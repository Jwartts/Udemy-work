  <h3> Introduction</h3>
  <p>Perhaps it all started as being socially aware. The younger of two children from my mom, the only of my dad's, attending a predominately white elementary school 30 minutes away from my hood.
    Later to become a non-Lutheran in a Lutheran school where my first memorable lunches were with my <i>fake</i> gang-member coparts, brainstorming gang signs to our moniker 'Triple H' (dont ask me what
    that stood for)
    and swearing I would never suck dick because it was <i>nasty</i>. Of course, that was a couple years after my mom returned from New York, realizing her dreams were no more tangible there than they were with a 9-year-old daughter, and several
    years
    after my dad married a woman 15 years younger than himself who came with a toddler and not one clear parenting skill. (Luckily for me, there was Codey--my dog, or dawg, <i>both really!</i>).</p>
  <p>
    My first boyfriend was a teenage hoodlum that wrote me letters from a juvenile detention center, my first love, at 17, was 5 years older than I --and 5 years older than the age of consent (for all those wondering). That eventual heartbreak
    happened one year before I eagerly moved across the country to attend a PWI that didnt have enough money to fully
    support a black girl (or her goals) with a 3.8 GPA and more athletic skill than half the current basketball team. I graduated four years later, hating that school as much as I hated being at home four years earlier. Fast forward to many failed
    attempts at medschool (<i> i blame systemic racisim to feel better about my potential inadequacy)</i>, losing all 3-5 of my best friends in one conversation, and simultaneously earning a Master's in public health while winning my only
    championship as a division I coach (grad assistant actually-- but let
    me be great), and here I am as a biomedical/social behavioral/evaluation research scientist (how did I end up here?). </p>
  <p>

    For better or worse, as an inchoate PhD candidate of the class of 2024/5/6ish, I've finally come to realize that, 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Imposter syndrome</a> is real-- perhaps thanks to an untreated
    concussion in 4th grade, and 2) life isn't as deep as a lot of people
    make it out to be. What this means is, either I'm a melodramatic human in an appropriately-dramatic world, or I'm a realist that has been through my fair share of <i> humorous</i> fuckery all before the age of 30, and <b>I KNOW</b> life's lemons
    are not as bitter as people make them out to be. Either way, I've become extremely aware that it's not me; its absolutely every one else. And although there's more --a lot more actually, for sake of
    keeping the rest of this interesting; <em><strong> This shall suffice as one hell of an introduction.</strong></em> </p>
